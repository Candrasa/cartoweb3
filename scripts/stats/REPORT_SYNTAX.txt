Syntax of the reports definition files
======================================

The format used is the same as in the legacy windows INI files.

Each section represents a different report, with the section name being the
report name.

A typical section looks like that:
--------------
[scale project]
; A comment
label = Stats per scale and per project
type = simple
periods.day = 30
periods.month = 12
periods.year = 5
values = pixel, count,countPDF,countDXF
dimensions = project
filters.project = sitn, jura
--------------

The fields are:
  - label:      Label show on the GUI for the report
  - type:       Type of report (see bellow)
  - periods.*:  How to divide the time (see bellow)
  - values:     What are the values show (see bellow)
  - dimensions: What criteria you want to be able to specify in the GUI (see bellow)
  - filters.*:  What records you want to take into account (see bellow)


Types
=====

The currently available types are:
  - simple:     For generating graphs or tables
  - gridbbox:   For generating colored maps based on the bbox of the viewed maps
  - gridcenter: For generating colored maps based on the center of the viewed maps

If the type is "gridbox" or "gridcenter", you have to add a few fields in the
configuration that will define the position, size and granularity of the grid
box. For example:
--------------
type = gridbbox
minx = 522000
miny = 187000
size = 500
nx = 106
ny = 76
--------------


Periods
=======

The possible period units are:
  - hour
  - day
  - week
  - month
  - year

The value specifies the number of those units to keep in the DB. Here is an
example for generating a report aggregated by week, for the last 12 weeks:
--------------
periods.week = 12
--------------

The report generator consider the current time as being the time of the last
hit matching the filters. A period is taken into account even if there is no
record for this period. 


Values
======

A list, separated by ',' of any of the following:
  - count:    The number of hits (no PDF or DXF outputs)
  - countPDF: The number of PDF generated
  - countDXF: The number of DXF generated
  - pixel:    The sum of pixels generated


Dimensions
==========

A list, separted by ',' of any of the following:
  - project
  - user
  - scale
  - width
  - height
  - theme
  - layer
  - pdfFormat
  - pdfRes

If you use the "scale" dimension, you have to add a field to specifiy the limits
for the discretization of the scale value. For example:
--------------
dimensions = scale
scales=1000,5000,10000,50000,100000,500000,1000000,5000000
--------------


Filters
=======

You can put as many filters as you want, one line per filter. The filters
available are (you must prepend 'filters.'):
  - scale:     a range of scales (floating points)
               ex: filter.scale=1000.5-5000
  - width:     a range of map width
               ex: filter.width=290-350
  - height:    a range of map height
               ex: filter.height=290-350
  - project:   a list, separated by ',' of project names
               ex: filter.project=sitn,agri
  - layer:     a list, separated by ',' of layer names
               ex: filter.layer=cn*,rel35b
  - theme:     a list, separated by ',' of theme names
               ex: filter.theme=orthophotos,default
  - user:      a list, separated by ',' of user names
               ex: filter.user=Jules,Jean
  - pdfFormat: a list, separated by ',' of PDF format names
               ex: filter.pdfFormat=A4,A5
  - pdfRes:    a range of PDF resolution
               ex: filter.pdfRes=290-350

For list of names, you can use '*' for matching any string of character. For
example, "cn*" will match "cn25" and "cn50".

For ranges of values, you can give either a range like '2-5' or a simple value
like '4'.
