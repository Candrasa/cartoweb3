  <title>Calling Plugins</title>
  <para>This chapter describes the structure of SOAP calls to CartoWeb server 
    methods in order to obtain cartographic data. Global WSDL code can be found 
    in file 
    <programlisting>CARTOWEB_HOME/server/cartoserver.wsdl</programlisting> WSDL 
    code specific to plugins are located in 
    <programlisting>PLUGIN_HOME/common/plugin_name.wsdl.inc</programlisting> 
    Interesting parts from these files are copied in the following sections. 
    Complete WSDL code dynamically generated for a map ID is accessible at the 
    URL 
    <programlisting>CARTOWEB_URL/cartoserver.wsdl.php?mapId=project_name.mapfile_name</programlisting> 
    </para>
  <para>SOAP method getMapInfo is used to retrieve server configuration 
    information, such as available layers, initial state, etc.. It shouldn't 
    be called each time a map is requested. A mechanism based on a timestamp 
    is available to be sure configuration is up-to-date (see <xref 
    linkend="dev.soapcalls.getmapinfo" />).</para>
    <para>SOAP method getMap is used each time a new map or related 
      information are needed.</para>
