style

 * Pear coding standards, with some exceptions.
 * use space, no tabs !!

base policy

 * Be independent of absolute paths ! : cartoclient and server should 
    be able to be relocated with very minimal if none reconfiguration
  
 * Extract and run deployment: it should be possible to extract the archive,
  launch a script, edit few options, and be ready to use the application with
  the built-in data set (see test mapfile).
  
 * Developers should absolutely set the following variables to true in their config :

   showDevelMessages = true
   developerIniConfig = true

 * You should add unit tests for every new features you add
 
 * all features should be available on the test mapfile, and visible by default 

 * Code should produce no notices before going to cvs. Code should pass all tests

 launch following command line: php tests/phpunit.php AllTests
 
 * Avoid nesting blocks too deep:
 
 Instead of:
	for ($i = 0; $i < 10; i++) {
    	if (something ($i)) {
		    doMore ();
	    }
    }

 Use:

    for ($i = 0; $i < 10; i++) {
    	if (! something ($i))
		    continue;
	    doMore ();
    }
