style

 * Pear coding standards, with some exceptions.
 * use space, no tabs !!

base policy

 * Be independent of absolute paths ! : cartoclient and server should 
    be able to be relocated with very minimal if none reconfiguration
  
 * Extract and run deployment: it should be possible to extract the archive,
  launch a script, edit few options, and be ready to use the application with
  the built-in data set (see test mapfile).
  
 * test infrastructure: TBD
 
 * develop with notices enabled !!. Put this in your php.ini:
   
   display_errors = On
   error_reporting  =  E_ALL
  
 * Code should produce no notices before going to cvs. Code should pass all tests
